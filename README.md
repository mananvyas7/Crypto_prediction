# Crypto_prediction

1. Define Your Goal
Predict crypto price movements (classification: up/down) or future prices (regression).
Use historical price data, trading volume, and technical indicators as features.
Optional: Incorporate news sentiment analysis or on-chain data.

2. Collect and Preprocess Data
Data Sources
Yahoo Finance API (for historical prices)
Binance API / CoinGecko API (for real-time and market data)
Twitter, Reddit, News APIs (for sentiment analysis)
Preprocessing
Clean missing values
Normalize price & volume data
Generate technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, MACD)

3. Feature Engineering
Some key features:
Technical indicators: SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
Market sentiment: Positive vs. negative tweets, news headlines
On-chain metrics: Number of active addresses, transaction volume

4. Choose a Model
Traditional ML Models
Linear Regression, Decision Trees (basic models)
Random Forest, XGBoost (stronger for tabular data)
Deep Learning Models
LSTMs, GRUs (good for time series)
Transformers (e.g., Time-Series BERT) (for long-term patterns)
Reinforcement Learning
RL models like Deep Q-Networks (DQN) can help optimize trading strategies.

5. Train & Evaluate
Use train-test split (e.g., 80-20)
Choose evaluation metrics:
RMSE, MAE for regression
Accuracy, F1-score for classification

6. Deployment (Optional)
Flask/FastAPI for backend API
Streamlit/Dash for visualization
